# Football Pool App

![Screenshot](https://snipboard.io/W0Le8d.jpg)

This app uses a mix of Node.JS and MongoDB to create a 'Football Pool' app. The user will input names of the contestants, as well as the
total amount of games the contestant has voted for that have resulted in wins. They can then check who wins, which will be determined
by which contestant picked the most winning teams.

If multiple people are tied for most winning teams, the winner is chosen randomly.
